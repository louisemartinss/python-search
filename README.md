>:star: *An **IDE** (Integrated Development Environment) is a software application that provides a complete set of tools for programming, including a code editor, compiler or interpreter, debugger, and project management features, making it easier to write, test, and maintain code in one unified environment. Look up a very good IDE recommendation for those who want to practice any computing language for free*

>ðŸš€ *For anyone who feels **lost** in their studies and wants more clarity about where they are headed, a 'Roadmap' is the solution. A Roadmap provides an overview of all the requirements and stages you need to go through to advance to the next step and even explore other branches of this language if you want to get closer to them in the future.*
